* Snake Rules
- Imagine you have a grid of 22x22 pixel squares
- Each square can contain a rock, an apple, snake's head or snake's tail
- Snake's head moves in any direction on the grid
- The tail follows the head
- If the head lands on the same square as an apple the tail grows
- If the head lands on the same square as tail or rock you lose

* Snake Movement
- Variables xChange and yChange indicate the direction of movement
1. Add current head position to the start of previous positions list
2. Set current position to the current position plus change
3. Trim the length of previous positions list to tailLength

* Snake Movement
- Variables xChange = 1 yChange = 0 snake is going right
